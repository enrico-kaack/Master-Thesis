\subsection{RQ1: Can the Clean Code Analysis Platform be a useful addition to developers workflow besides existing tools?}
\paragraph{Motivation}
Several tools are established that aim to improve code quality and detect unclean code. Every new tool with similiar claims has to proove its usefulnes besides the preexisting tools. We compare the CCAP with existing tools based on the design goals expandability, useability and integration as well as (useful features in existing tools the CCAP was not planned for).
\paragraph{Approach}
To evaluate, if the CCAP is a useful addition, we comapre different features to see, if it can supplement or replace existing tools. As described in section TODO, the compared tools are Sonarcube, PMD Source Code Analyser Project, Codacy and PyLint.

\paragraph{Results}
Table TODO shows a summary of the features.
